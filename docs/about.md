# About

## Professional Background

I'm Werosh Kriyanjala, a builder obsessed with pairing ambitious ideas with thoughtful execution. Whether it's orchestrating full-stack platforms or refining the micro-interactions that users feel, I anchor every project on clarity, craft, and measurable results.

From leading web experiences at [NextGen Websites](https://www.nextgenwebsites.info/){:target="_blank"} to architecting internal tooling, I collaborate with founders, designers, and engineers to ship products that feel seamless and perform under pressure.
